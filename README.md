## Description
The following program is designed to meet the requirements of the module 19 challenge. It represents the beginnings of a progressive web application text editor. The web application was made using JavaScript, IndexedDB, Node.js, and Express.js. The deployment done via Heroku. The text editor allows users to write text in their browser. The text is stored in an IndexedDB database, which is a client-side storage system. Users can close the web application or install it on their own computer and their information will be stored and loaded the next time they use the app. Thus, the database supports two components within typical CRUD operations: users can create and retreive data that they have typed into the text editor.
